## Project Overview

The purpose of  the Restaurant Reviews project is to incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application, by take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. and also begin converting this to a Progressive Web Application by caching some assets for offline use.


### Requirements

Make the provided site fully responsive. All of the page elements should be usable and visible in any viewport, including desktop, tablet, and mobile displays. Images shouldn't overlap, and page elements should wrap when the viewport is too small to display them side by side.



## Instructions

You can [Open it here](https://haninfhd.github.io/fend-project-Restaurant-Reviews/) .
